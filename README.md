# Practice-Film-Analytics
**Allows coaches and managers to track and view advanced statistics for players' performance in practice**
--
A basketball practice film analysis application modeled after Synergy Sports, tailored for your universityâ€™s team. The app will track specific actions (like ball screens, cuts, drives, etc.) in practice footage, and generate video playlists of these actions, organized by player and action type. This tool aims to help coaches review tendencies, effectiveness, and decision-making of individual players or team sequences during practice sessions.
